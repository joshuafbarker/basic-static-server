# Basic Static Server
A basic static server for serving up a static website, built on node and express.

Basic Static Server is exactly what it sounds like; a very basic server for serving up a static website. It's built on top of <a href="#">NodeJS</a> and utilizes the <a href="#">Express</a> framework. It's very simple to use, and very simple to build on top of.

It's Basic.

#### How does it work?
Glad you asked.

First off, you need to make sure you have a couple of things installed on your machine.
* <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>
* <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a>

Then, once you have the repo cloned, open up your terminal and navigate to the appropriate directory, and install the dependencies.
    cd your-directory-name && npm install
    <p>Once all dependencies have been installed, you can start the server by running one of the following commands:</p>
    <code>
      <em>// start the server on the default port (3000)</em>
      npm start
      <em>// start the server on the specified port</em>
      npm start 4000
    </code>
    <p>Navigate to localhost:PORT_NUMBER to see your site live!</p>
    <h4>Folder Structure</h4>
    <p>Inside your directory you will find a folder called public. Inside this folder is where all of your site files will be placed.</p>
    <code>
      ðŸ“‚ your-directory-name<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“‚ node_modules<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ðŸ“‚ public</strong><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“‚ assets<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“‚ css<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“‚ js<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;index.html<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package.json<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server.js
    </code>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There must be an index.html file inside the root of the public folder in order for your site to be served properly from the root url (localhost:PORT_NUMBER). The rest is up to you.</p>
    <h4>One more thing...</h4>
    <p>This is not yet optimized for a production environment, but I hope to have it at that state in the near future. It is advised to <strong>NOT</strong> use this as your production server without something like <a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever" target="_blank">Forever</a> built in.</p>
